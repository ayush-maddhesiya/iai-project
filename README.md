# Snake Game AI

This project implements the classic Snake game with an AI that plays the game autonomously. The AI uses basic strategies to navigate the game grid, collect food, and avoid collisions with walls and its own body.

## Overview

The Snake Game AI project is built using Python and Pygame. The AI controls the snake's movement, making decisions to collect food and grow longer while avoiding obstacles. This project can be a great starting point for learning about AI in games, as well as exploring more advanced AI techniques.

## Features

- **Autonomous Snake AI**: The AI navigates the game grid to collect food and avoid collisions.
- **Collision Avoidance**: The AI uses basic look-ahead logic to prevent getting stuck in its own body or running into walls.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the score, which increases as the snake collects food.
- **Customizable Game Speed**: You can adjust the game's speed to make the AI play faster or slower.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-ai.git
    cd snake-game-ai
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

## How to Run

1. **Run the game**:
    Execute the main Python file to start the game:

    ```bash
    python snake_game_ai.py
    ```

2. **Observe the AI**:
    The AI will automatically start playing the game, controlling the snake's movements.

## AI Strategy

### Basic Movement

The AI controls the snake using the following logic:
- The snake moves towards the food by adjusting its direction.
- If the food is to the left or right of the snake, the AI turns accordingly.
- If the food is directly ahead, the AI continues moving straight.

### Collision Avoidance

- The AI looks ahead at its next move to determine if it will result in a collision (either with the wall or the snake's own body).
- If a collision is detected, the AI tries an alternative direction to avoid it.

### Frame Iteration

- To prevent the AI from getting stuck in an endless loop, the game will end if the snake does not collect food within a certain number of frame iterations.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential enhancements for the project:
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implement more advanced pathfinding algorithms like A* to optimize the AI's navigation.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train the AI using reinforcement learning techniques to improve its decision-making.
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Add different game modes, such as allowing human players to compete against the AI.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjust the game's difficulty dynamically based on the player's or AI's performance.
